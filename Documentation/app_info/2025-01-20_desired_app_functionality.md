# Database Auto-Deployment Feature Implementation

**Date**: 2025-01-20
**Feature**: Automatic Database Migration on Backend Startup
**Status**: ⌛ Pending Implementation

## Requirements

### Core Functionality
- Backend server must automatically check and apply database migrations on startup
- Process should be transparent and logged appropriately
- Startup should fail safely if database migration encounters critical errors
- Implementation should follow Entity Framework Core best practices

### Technical Specifications
- Integrate with existing Entity Framework Core setup in `RagChatDbContext`
- Use `context.Database.MigrateAsync()` for asynchronous migration
- Implement proper logging with structured information
- Include error handling with appropriate exception propagation

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Database migrations apply automatically on server startup
- ✅ Migration process is logged with clear information messages
- ✅ Server startup fails gracefully if migration encounters errors
- ✅ No manual `dotnet ef database update` commands required for deployment
- ✅ Compatible with both development and production environments

### Business Logic
- **Development Environment**: Auto-migration enables quick iteration without manual steps
- **Production Environment**: Ensures database schema is always up-to-date with application code
- **Error Handling**: Critical migration failures should prevent server startup to avoid runtime issues

### Implementation Notes
- Add migration logic after `var app = builder.Build()` in Program.cs
- Use dependency injection to access `RagChatDbContext` and `ILogger<Program>`
- Wrap migration in try-catch block with appropriate logging
- Consider scope management for dependency injection during startup

## Expected Benefits
1. **Developer Experience**: Eliminates manual migration step from development workflow
2. **Deployment Reliability**: Ensures database schema consistency across environments
3. **Operational Efficiency**: Reduces deployment complexity and human error potential
4. **Monitoring**: Provides clear logging for database migration operations
